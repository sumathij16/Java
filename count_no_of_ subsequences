Given a string s, the task is to count number of subsequences of the form aibjck, where i >= 1, j >=1 and k >= 1.
Note: Two subsequences are considered different if the set of array indexes picked for the 2 subsequences are different.

Examples:
Input  : abbc
Output : 3
Subsequences are abc, abc and abbc

Input  : abcabc
Output : 7
Subsequences are abc, abc, abbc, aabc
abcc, abc and abc
